Additional utilities and helpers for working with [firebridge](https://pub.dev/packages/firebridge). Forked from nyxx_extensions to provide support for user accounts.

While the main [firebridge](https://pub.dev/packages/firebridge) package focuses on providing a wrapper only for the features described in [Discord's developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), this package contains a collection of commonly used functions and plugins when making Discord bots, such as [pagination](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx_extensions/latest/nyxx_extensions/Pagination-class.html), [sanitization](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx_extensions/latest/nyxx_extensions/sanitizeContent.html) or [endpoint pagination](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx_extensions/latest/search.html?q=stream).

This package is very open to contributions as it is built upon the needs of developers using [nyxx](https://pub.dev/packages/nyxx). If you find yourself implementing a feature that isn't specific to your bot, please consider [opening a pull request](https://github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx_extensions/pulls) and add your code to this package. Read our [contribution document](https://github.com/nyxx-discord/nyxx_extensions/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
